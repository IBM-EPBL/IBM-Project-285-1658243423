Program 1:

Write a python program to test a given number is prime or not.

num = int(input())
if num > 1:
   for i in range(2,num):
       if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number")


Program 2:

Write a program to generate odd numbers from m to n using while loop:

n = int(input())
m = int(input())

while(n<=m):
    if(n%2!=0):
        print(n,end=" ")
    n+=1

Program 3:

Write a Python program to display prime number series up to given number.

num = int(input())

for n in range(2,num + 1):
   if n > 1:
       for i in range(2,n):
           if (n % i) == 0:
               break
       else:
           print(n,end = " ")

Program 4:

Write a Python program to generate Fibonacci series.

n = int(input())
a = 0
b = 1
sum = 0
count = 1
while(count <= n):
  print(sum, end = " ")
  count += 1
  a = b
  b = sum
  sum = a + b
